[section New Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/accumulators/ Accumulators]:] Framework for
  incremental calculation, and collection of statistical accumulators, from Eric Niebler.
]

* /TODO/

[endsect]

[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Move semantics for shared objects ([ticket 1932]).
  * Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements ([github_pr interprocess 32])
  * Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify ([github interprocess 62])
]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/multi_index/ Multi-index Containers]:]
  * Added [@/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/basics.html#node_handling node extraction and insertion]
    following the analogous interface of associative containers as introduced in C++17.
    This feature has also been extended to non key-based indices, in contrast to C++
    standard library sequence containers, which do not provide such functionality.
  * Clarified documentation on read/write key extractors (issue [github multi_index 32]).
  * Maintenance work.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/poly_collection/ PolyCollection]:]
  * Fixed internal ambiguity problem between `boost::type_erasure::any` and
    `boost::any` (issue [github poly_collection 17]).
  * Maintenance work.
  
* /TODO/
