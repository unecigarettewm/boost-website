[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/atomic/ Atomic]:]
    * Fixed possible incorrect code generation in 64-bit atomic operations on 32-bit x86 with gcc versions older than 4.7 and compatible compilers.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/context/ Context]:]
    * new API: call/cc
    * deprecated API:execution-context
    * [ticket 12719] segmentation fault when built with mingw-w64
    * #38: context_entry() crashes on macOS
    * #39: Unknown directive .cpu on aarch64 with Clang 3.8 on Android

* [phrase library..[@/libs/core/ Core]:]
    * Implemented `constexpr` `addressof` on compilers that support C++11 `constexpr` and SFINAE expressions. `BOOST_CORE_NO_CONSTEXPR_ADDRESSOF` macro indicates when `constexpr` `addressof` is not available.
    * In `lightweight_test.hpp`, added new macros `BOOST_TEST_ALL_EQ` and `BOOST_TEST_ALL_WITH` for testing container contents.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/coroutine2/ Coroutine2]:]
    * #4: coroutine2<> does not accept std::bind

* [phrase library..[@/libs/fiber/ Fiber]:]
    * #100: ASIO: unbuffered_channel / scheduler notify issue
    * #106: Passing a fixed_stack allocator to async/packaged_task doesn't compile
    * #111: endless-loop in buffered_channel::try_value_pop()
    * (un)bounded_channel<> removed

* [phrase library..[@/libs/program_options/ Program Options]:]
  * Support for storing values into `boost::optional`, thanks to Ed Catmur
    ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7495 #7495],
     [@https://github.com/boostorg/program_options/pull/18 PR#18])

* /TODO/

[/ TODO: These libraries always use the same message, referring to their
   individual release notes. So check if they apply before the beta:

* /TODO/: [phrase library..[@/libs/spirit/ Spirit]:]
  * Spirit Vx.x, see the
    '[@/doc/libs/1_xx_x/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/what_s_new/spirit_x_x.html What's New]'
    section for details.

* /TODO/: [phrase library..[@/libs/wave/ Wave]:]
  * See the [@/libs/wave/ChangeLog Changelog] for details.
