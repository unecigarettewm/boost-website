[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Move semantics for shared objects ([ticket 1932]).
  * Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements ([github_pr interprocess 32])
  * Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify ([github interprocess 62])
]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/compat/ Compat]:]
  * Added `bind_front.hpp`, `bind_back.hpp`, `invoke.hpp`, `mem_fn.hpp`, `integer_sequence.hpp` and `type_traits.hpp`.
  * Added `function_ref.hpp`.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/crc/ CRC]:]
  * C++03 is no longer supported; a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.6 or later, and MSVC 10.0 (VS 2010) or later.)
  * Removed dependencies on Array, Config, Integer, and TypeTraits. The
    library is now standalone.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/format/ Format]:]
  * C++03 is no longer supported; a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.7 or later, and MSVC 12.0 (VS 2013) or later.)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/function/ Function]:]
  * Removed dependency on Boost.TypeTraits.
  * Brought back the `argN_type` typedefs that were accidentally lost in 1.85.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/graph/ Graph]:]
  * _Major_ update: C++14 is the new minimum standard; this was partly dictated by dependencies (at least to C++11) and partly by choice. If you require support for an older standard, please contact the maintainer.
  * Remove direct dependency on Boost.Regex.
  * Fix several compilation errors caused by not explicitly including common headers.
  * `isomorphism`: Fix docs, ignore `vertex_max_invariant` parameter in favour of cheaply calculating upper exclusive bound, fix bug with Associative Property Map, improve space efficiency from linear in the size of the maximum invariant to linear in the size of g1.
  * `boykov_kolmogorov_max_flow`: Fix named parameter overload.
  * `adj_list_edge_iterator`: Fix maybe-uninitialized warnings.
  * `hawick_circuits`: Add a parameter to optionally limit the depth of the search, causing a potentially suboptimal answer to be returned early.
  * `disjoint_sets`: Improve performance of `link_sets` by removing redundant lookup of set representatives.
  * `maximum_adjacency_search`: Refactor and more tests.
  * `property`: Use `BOOST_ATTRIBUTE_NO_UNIQUE_ADDRESS` to remove wasted space.
  * `labeled_graph`: Fix `remove_labeled_vertex` so that it actually removes the label too.
  * `r_c_shortest_paths`: Fix bug that the single-solution variant did not always return the shortest path.
  * `read_graphviz`: Fix stack overflow (oss-fuzz issue 66719) and non-keyword subgraph parsing.
  * Many miscellaneous improvements: broken links, typos, etc.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/stacktrace/ Stacktrace]:]
  * [*Big new feature: stacktrace from arbitrary exception for Windows].
    `std::stacktrace::from_current_exception()` now works on Windows platform.
    Many thanks to [@https://github.com/huangqinjin huangqinjin] for the
    implementation [github_pr stacktrace 159]
    Now on POSIX and Windows the `from_current_exception() ` function
    returns the stacktrace of the current exception object as if the stacktrace
    was captured at the point of throwing the exception.
  * Fixed inclusion of rarely used Windows SDK headers which can cause
    conflict with other code using Windows SDK. Thanks to
    [@https://github.com/mabrarov Marat Abrarov] for fixing the issue
    [github_pr stacktrace 157].
  * Build option `boost.stacktrace.from_exception` now properly works
    on MacOS. Thanks to [@https://github.com/pdimov Peter Dimov] for the fix
    [github_pr stacktrace 166].
  * Fixed a typo in assert expression. Thanks to [@https://github.com/Ukilele Kilian Henneberger]
    for the bug report [github stacktrace 164].
  * Fixed shadowing warnings. Thanks to [@https://github.com/nigels-com Nigel Stewart]
    for the bug report [github stacktrace 141].
  * Added `dladdr` minimal support for AIX. Many thanks to Cl√©ment Chigot
    for the implementation [github_pr stacktrace 114].
  * Added `Boost::stacktrace` CMake alias that refers to the best supported
    implementation of Boost.Stacktrace on the platform. Thanks to [@https://github.com/leha-bot Alex]
    for the feature [github_pr stacktrace 167].
  * Significant improvement of CMake: multiple fixes, added many new tests,
    improved CI. Many thanks to [@https://github.com/pdimov Peter Dimov] for all the improvements.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/uuid/ UUID]:]
  * _Major_ update.
  * C++03 is no longer supported, a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.8 or later, MSVC 14.0 (VS 2015) or later, and MinGW-w64.)
  * Decreased number of Boost dependencies from 39 (in total) to just 5.
  * Updated to reflect the newer [@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9562/ RFC 9562].
  * Added generators for time-based UUIDs.
  * _Many_ other improvements, see the [@/libs/uuid/doc/html/uuid.html#changes revision history].
