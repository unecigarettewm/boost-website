[section Modularization]

Boost version control has migrated to a system using git submodules.
This shouldn't make too much of a difference to users, although the
directory structure is now a bit different.

Parts of some libraries have been moved into different modules, and several
new modules have been extracted from existing code.
All header paths should remain the same. The new modules are:

* [phrase library..[@/libs/assert/ Assert]:]
  Customizable assert macros. Maintained by Peter Dimov.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/core/ Core]:]
  Core utilities used by other libraries, with minimal dependencies. Maintained by Peter Dimov, Glen Fernandes and Andrey Semashev.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/lexical_cast/ Lexical_Cast]:]
  General literal text conversions, such as an int represented a string, or vice-versa, from Kevlin Henney.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/throw_exception/ Throw_Exception]:]
  A common infrastructure for throwing exceptions from Boost libraries, from Emil Dotchevski.
* [phrase library..Winapi:]
  Windows API declarations without <windows.h>, for internal Boost use.


[endsect]

[section New Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/align/ Align]:]
  Memory alignment functions, allocators, and adaptors, from Glen Fernandes.
* [phrase library..[@/libs/type_index/ Type_Index]:]
  Runtime/Compile time copyable type info, from Antony Polukhin.

[endsect]

[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/accumulators/ Acumulators]:]
  * New accumulators `rolling_variance` and `rolling_moment`

* [phrase library..[@/libs/any/ Any]:]
  * Fixed rvalue references related issues ([ticket 9215], [ticket 9462]).
  * Dropped support of antique compilers.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/asio/ Asio]:]
  * Fixed `asio::spawn()` to work correctly with new Boost.Coroutine interface
    ([ticket 9442], [ticket 9928]).
  * Ensured that incomplete `asio::spawn()` coroutines are correctly unwound when
    cleaned up by the `io_service` destructor ([ticket 9731]).
  * Fixed delegation of continuation hook for handlers produced by
    `io_service::wrap()` and `strand::wrap()` ([ticket 9741]).
  * Changed the Windows I/O completion port backend to use `ConnectEx`, if
    available, for connection-oriented IP sockets.
  * Changed the `io_service` backend for non-Windows (and non-IOCP Windows)
    platforms to use a single condition variable per `io_service` instance.
    This addresses a potential race condition when `run_one()` is used from
    multiple threads.
  * Prevented integer overflow when computing timeouts based on some
    `boost::chrono` and `std::chrono` clocks ([ticket 9662], [ticket 9778]).
  * Made further changes to `EV_CLEAR` handling in the kqueue backend, to address
    other cases where the `close()` system call may hang on Mac OS X.
  * Fixed infinite recursion in implementation of
    `resolver_query_base::flags::operator~` ([ticket 9548]).
  * Made the `select` reactor more efficient on Windows for large numbers of
    sockets ([ticket 9528]).
  * Fixed a Windows-specific type-aliasing issue reported by [^gcc] ([ticket
    9550]).
  * Prevented execution of compile-time-only buffer test to avoid triggering an
    address sanitiser warning ([ticket 8295]).
  * Disabled the `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` timeout workaround on recent
    versions of Windows.
  * Added support for string-based scope IDs when using link-local multicast
    addresses.
  * Changed IPv6 multicast group join to use the address's scope ID as the
    interface, if an interface is not explicitly specified.
  * Fixed multicast test failure on Mac OS X and the BSDs by using a link-local
    multicast address.
  * Worked around a [^gcc] problem to do with anonymous enums ([ticket 10042]).
  * Reverted the Windows `HANDLE` backend change to ignore `ERROR_MORE_DATA`.
    Instead, the error will be propagated as with any other (i.e. in an
    `error_code` or thrown as a `system_error`), and the number of bytes
    transferred will be returned. For code that needs to handle partial messages,
    the `error_code` overload should be used ([ticket 10034]).
  * Fixed an off-by-one error in the `signal_set` implementation's signal
    number check ([ticket 9324]).
  * Changed to use SSE2 intrinsics rather than inline assembly, to allow the
    Cray compiler to work.
  * Stopped using certain Winsock functions that are marked as deprecated in the
    latest Visual C++ and Windows SDK.
  * Added a workaround for building the unit tests with [^gcc] on AIX.
  * Various minor documentation improvements ([ticket 8295], [ticket 9605],
    [ticket 9771]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/assign/ Assign]:]
  * Resolve some C++11 ambiguities ([ticket 3073]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/atomic/ Atomic]:]
  * The library has been redesigned. Besides internal refactoring, various bugs were fixed, including incorrect values of feature test macros and integer overflow handling.
  * Changed values of the `memory_order` enumeration. The concrete values are not part of the interface, but this change may potentially break ABI, if the enum is used in user's interfaces.
  * Implemented support for 128-bit atomic operations on Windows x64 with MSVC. The library assumes presence of the `cmpxchg16b` instruction in the target CPUs. Some early AMD CPUs don't support this instruction. To target those define the `BOOST_ATOMIC_NO_CMPXCHG16B` macro.
  * Implemented experimental support for Windows ARM target with MSVC.
  * Implemented experimental support for DEC Alpha target with GCC.
  * Improved support for ARMv6 and later with GCC. Implemented all atomic operations as assembler blocks instead of CAS-based loops. 64-bit operations are supported with ARMv7.
  * Implemented optional support for the `BOOST_ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT` macro and static initialization of `atomic_flag`. ([ticket 8158])
  * Fixed compilation for SPARCv9 target. ([ticket 9446])
  * Fixed compilation for PowerPC target. ([ticket 9447])
  * Fixed several compatibility problems with Clang on x86 and x86-64. ([ticket 9610], [ticket 9842])
  * Removed specialized code for Windows on IA64 platform.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/circular_buffer/ Circular Buffer]:]
  * [ticket 9970],[ticket 9334] Support for the C++11 allocator model.
  * Dropped support of antique compilers.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/concept_check/ Concept Check]:]
  * Fewer warnings (includes [ticket 5012]).
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/container/ Container]:]
  * Added DlMalloc-based Extended Allocators.
  * Improved configurability of tree-based ordered associative containers. AVL, Scapegoat and Splay trees are now available
     to implement `set`, `multiset`, `map` and `multimap`.
  * Fixed bugs:
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9338 #9338: ['"VS2005 compiler errors in swap() definition after including container/memory_util.hpp"]].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/flyweight/index.html Flyweight]:]
  * In compilers with variadic template support, `boost::flyweight<T>` now provides a perfectly forwarding
    constructor to `T::T` (previously an emulation was used).
  * `flyweight` now replicates the initializer-list constructors and assignment operators of its underlying type.
  * Fixed intermodule static initialization problem (ticket [ticket 9553]).
  * Maintenance fixes.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/fusion/ Fusion]:]
  * Fusion is enabled for use on GPU

* [phrase library..[@/libs/geometry/ Geometry]:]

    * [@https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/pull/3 GitHub #3 (['"Fix/mingw interprocess_exception throw in file_wrapper::priv_open_or_create"])].
  *  [*ABI breaking]: [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9221 #9221] showed
     that `BOOST_INTERPROCESS_MSG_QUEUE_CIRCULAR_INDEX` option of message queue,
     was completely broken so an ABI break was necessary to have a working implementation.
  *  Simplified, refactored and unified (timed_)lock code based on try_lock().
     There were several bugs when handling timeout expirations.
  *  Changed the implementation of condition variables' destructors to allow POSIX semantics
     (the condition variable can be destroyed after all waiting threads have been woken up)..
  *  Added `BOOST_INTERPROCESS_SHARED_DIR_PATH` option to define the shared directory used to place shared memory objects
     when implemented as memory mapped files.
  *  Added support for `BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H`. When this macro is defined Interprocess does not declare
     used Windows API function and types, includes all needed windows SDK headers and uses types and
     functions declared by the Windows SDK.
  *  Added `get_size` to `windows_shared_memory`.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/intrusive/ Intrusive]:]  
  
  *  Improved Doxygen generated reference and updated and fixed forward-declaration header.
  *  [*ABI breaking]: Fixed ABI regression introduced in Boost 1.55 version, mainly noticeable on MSVC compilers.
  *  [*Source breaking]: Removed previously deprecated `xxx_dont_splay` functions from splay containers,
     `splay_set_base_hook` and `splay_set_member_hook`from splay containers and `bool splay = true`
     extra parameter in `splaytree_algorithms` functions.
  *  Fixed bugs:
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8468 #8468: Compile error on visual studio 2010/2012 using vector with custom allocator and aligned types]
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9332 #9332: ['"has_member_function_callable_with.hpp compile error on msvc-12.0"]].
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9650 #9650: ['"intrusive list with stateful value traits"]].
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9746 #9746: Modern Sun CC compiler detects error in intrusive library header]
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9940 #9940: bad bug in intrusive list with safe_link (or auto_unlink) hooks]
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9948 #9948: remove use of const_cast in intrusive containers]
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9949 #9949: clear header node hooks upon intrusive container destruction]
     *  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9961 #9961: tests for hooks not derived frorm generic_hook]
  *  Optimized tree rebalancing code to avoid redundant assignments.
  *  Added 64 bit prime values for `suggested_upper_bucket_count`/`suggested_lower_bucket_count` in 64 bit platforms.
  *  Deleted workarounds for old SUN_CC compilers, those are now unsupported as modern SunPro compilers are standard-corforming enough.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/lexical_cast/ Lexical Cast]:]
  * Added the `try_lexical_convert` function, that retuns `false` in case of failed conversion and
    does not require output parameter to be Default Constructable ([ticket 6700]).
  * Fixed conversion of string values with leading zeroes to `bool` ([ticket 9659]).
  * Code was changed to produce a smaller binaries and simplify compiler's work ([ticket 9046]).
  * Boost.LexicalCast library was separated from the Boost.Conversion library.
  * Fixed some warnings ([ticket 8991]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/log/index.html Log]:]
  * General changes:
    * For Windows targets, the library now compiles for Windows XP by default.
    * Added indexing operators with `attribute_name` arguments to `record` and `record_view`.
    * Added operators for non-const object output to `basic_formatting_ostream`. ([ticket 9389])
    * Added support for putting function names and source file names of named scopes into the formatted strings. ([ticket 9263])
    * Added support for incomplete and empty markers to the named scope formatter. ([ticket 9123])
    * The default presentation for incomplete named scope lists has changed: trailing scope delimiter is omitted.
    * Added a support header for `std::regex`.
    * By default Boost.Log uses Boost.Regex internally as the regular expressions backend. The backend can be changed by defining configuration macros.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed `dump` manipulator output on AVX2-enabled CPUs (e.g. Intel Haswell).
    * Fixed compilation of `get_attribute` method of loggers.
    * Fixed a possible race in `locked_backend()` function implementation of synchronous and asynchronous sink frontends.
    * Fixed a possible infinite block of the logging threads in the asynchronous sink enqueue methods when `block_on_overflow` strategy was used.
  * See [@/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html changelog] for more details.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/math/index.html Math]:]
  * [*Breaking change]: moved a number of non-core headers that are predominantly used for internal
    maintenance into `libs/math/include_private`.  The headers effected are `boost/math/tools/test_data.hpp`,
    `boost/math/tools/remez.hpp`, `boost/math/constants/generate.hpp`, `boost/math/tools/solve.hpp`,
    `boost/math/tools/test.hpp`.
    You can continue to use these headers by adding `libs/math/include_private` to your compiler's include path.
  * [*Breaking change]: A number of distributions and special functions were returning the maximum finite value
    rather than raising an overflow_error, this has now been fixed, which means these functions now behave as
    documented.  However, since the default behavior on raising an overflow_error is to throw a `std::overflow_error`
    exception, applications which have come to reply rely on these functions not throwing may experience exceptions
    where they did not before.  The special functions involved are gamma_p_inva, gamma_q_inva, 
    ibeta_inva, ibetac_inva, ibeta_invb, ibetac_invb, gamma_p_inv, gamma_q_inv.  The distributions
    involved are pareto_distrib, beta_distrib, geometric_distrib, negative_binomial_distrib,
    binomial_distrib, chi_squared_distrib, gamma_distrib, inverse_chi_squared_distrib, 
    inverse_gamma_distrib.  See [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10111 #10111].
  * Fix round and trunc functions so they can be used with integer arguments, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10066 #10066].
  * Fix Halley iteration to handle zero derivative (with non-zero second derivative), see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10046 #10046].
  * Fix Geometric distribution use of Policies, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9833 #9833].
  * Fix corner cases in the negative binomial distribution, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9834 #9834].
  * Fix compilation failures on Mac OS.
  * Added bernoulli_numbers, changed arbitrary precision tgamma/lgamma to use Sterling's approximation (from Nikhar Agrawal).
  * Added first derivatives of the Bessel functions: cyl_bessel_j_prime, cyl_neumann_prime, cyl_bessel_i_prime, cyl_bessel_k_prime, sph_bessel_prime and sph_neumann_prime (from Anton Bikineev).
  * Fixed buggy Student's t example code, along with docs for testing sample means for equivalence.
  * Documented `max_iter` parameter in root finding code better, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9225 #9225].
  * Add option to explicitly enable/disable use of __float128 in constants code, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9240 #9240].
  * Cleaned up handling of negative values in Bessel I0 and I1 code (removed dead code), see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9512 #9512].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/multi_index/index.html Multi-index Containers]:]
  * The `erase(iterator)` member function of hashed indices used to have poor performance under low load
    conditions due to the requirement that an iterator to the next element must be returned
    (see ticket [ticket 4264]). In accordance with the resolution of
    [@http://lwg.github.io/issues/lwg-closed.html#579 LWG issue #579], this problem has been fixed
    while maintaining the interface of `erase`, at the expense of using one more word of memory per element.
    In fact, C++ complexity requirements on unordered associative containers have been improved for hashed
    indices so that
    [itemized_list
      [deletion of a given element is unconditionally constant-time,]
      [worst-case performance is not `O(n)` but
      '''<code>O(n<subscript>dist</subscript>)</code>''', where
      '''<code>n<subscript>dist</subscript></code>''' is the number of
      non-equivalent elements in the index.]
    ]
    Due to the fact that hashed indices rely on a new data structure, the internal representation of their
    iterators and local iterators have changed, which affects serialization: their corresponding serialization
    [@/libs/serialization/doc/tutorial.html#versioning class version] has been bumped from 0 to 1. Old archives
    involving hashed index (local) iterators can be loaded by Boost 1.56 version of Boost.MultiIndex, but not
    the other way around. 
  * Hashed indices now provide `reserve`.
  * Hashed indices can now be checked for equality and inequality following the (suitably adapted) C++ standard
    specification in [*\[unord.req\]].
  * The public interface of Boost.MultiIndex provide `noexcept` specifications where appropriate (for compliant
    compilers).
  * Improved performance of failed insertions into a `multi_index_container`.
  * Much internal code aimed at supporting MSVC++ 7.0 and prior has been removed. Compilation times without this
    legacy code might be slightly faster.
  * Fixed a bug with insertion via iterators dereferencing to rvalues (ticket [ticket 9665]).
  * Made Boost.MultiIndex compatible with `BOOST_BIND_NO_PLACEHOLDERS` (ticket [ticket 9798]). 
  * Maintenance fixes.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/multiprecision/ Multiprecision]:]
  * Change floating point to rational conversions to be implicit, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10082 10082].
  * Fix definition of checked_cpp_rational typedef.
  * Fix bug in assignment from string in cpp_int, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9936 9936].

  * Fixed various typos in docs, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9432 9432].
  * Fixed gmp_rational to allow move-copy from an already copied-from object, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9497 9497].
  * Added list of values for numeric_limits.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/numeric/odeint/ Odeint]:]
  * Added algebra and operations dispatcher for automatic detection of appropriate algebras and operations.
  * Added support for Eigen, Boost.Multiarray, Boost.Mpi, Boost.Compute, Blaze, and NT2.
  * Changed algebra interface to use algebra.norm_inf function.
  * Added iterators for iterating through the solution of the ODEs, hence an alternative to the integrate functions.
  * Added the Velocity-Verlet method.
  * Minor bug fixes.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/optional/ Optional]:]
  * Added support for rvalue references. Now `optional<T>` works with moveable but non-copyable `T`'s.
  * Improved `swap` (now uses move operations).
  * Added function `emplace()`. This is the last of the requests from [ticket 1841].
  * `optional` is moveable, including conditional `noexcept` specifications, which make it `move_if_noexcept`-friendly.
  * Using explicit operator bool() on platforms that support it ([ticket 4227]) (breaking change).
  * Forward declaration of `operator<<(ostream&, optional const&)` to prevent inadvertent incorrect serialization of optional objects.
  * Removed depprecated function `reset()` from examples ([ticket 9005]).
  * Equality comparison with `boost::none` does not require that `T` be EqualityComparable.
  * Optional rvalue references are explicitly disallowed.
  * Binding temporaries to optional references is explicitly disallowed (breaking change).
  * More ways to access the contained value, functions `value()`, `value_or()`, `value_or_eval()`.
  * Updated and reorganized documentation, added tutorial and quick guide sections.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/predef/ Predef]:]
  * Addition of `BOOST_PLAT_*` platform definitions for MinGW and
    Windows platform variants.
  * Detection of ARM architecture for Windows compilers to target
    mobile devices of Windows 8.
  * Improved ARM detection for 64 bit ARM.
  * Added detection of iOS as an operating system.
  * Improved detection of endianess on some platforms.
  * Addition of exclusive plus emulated definitions for platform
    and compiler detection.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/preprocessor/ Preprocessor]:]
  * When using variadic macros tuple functionality was added to match all the array functionality.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/program_options/ Program Options]:]
  * Columns in the `--help` output are now aligned across all option groups ([ticket 6114]).
  * Option names with dashes are no longer truncated in error messages ([ticket 8009]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/regex/index.html Regex]:]
  * [*Breaking change:] corrected behavior of `basic_regex<>::mark_count()` to match existing documentation, `basic_regex<>::subexpression(n)` changed to match, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9227 #9227]
  * Fixed issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8903 #8903].
  * Fixed documentation typos from [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9283 #9283].
  * Fixed bug in collation code that failed if the locale generated collation strings with embedded nul's, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9451 #9451].
  * Apply patch for unusual thread usage (no statically initiallized mutexes), see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9461 #9461].
  * Added better checks for invalid UTF-8 sequences, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9473 #9473].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/smart_ptr/ Smart Pointers]:]
  * Updated the overloads of [@/libs/smart_ptr/make_shared_array.html make_shared]
    and [@/libs/smart_ptr/make_shared_array.html allocate_shared] of array types (`T[]` or 
    `T[N]`) to conform to the specification in C++ standard paper
    [@http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3939.html N3939] and
    significantly reduced the spatial overhead of the internal bookkeeping structures.
  * Updated the implementations of make_shared and
    allocate_shared for scalar types and array types, respectively, to resolve C++ standard
    library defect report [@http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/lwg-active.html#2070 #2070].
