[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Move semantics for shared objects ([ticket 1932]).
  * Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements ([github_pr interprocess 32])
  * Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify ([github interprocess 62])
]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/bind/ Bind]:]
  * C++03 is no longer supported; a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.7 or later, and MSVC 12.0 (VS 2013) or later.)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/conversion/ Conversion]:]
  * Removed outdated mentions of `boost::lexical_cast` that is not part of the
    library any more. Thanks to
    [@https://github.com/eoan-ermine Danil Sidoruk] for the PR
    [github_pr conversion 28]!

* [phrase library..[@/libs/function/ Function]:]
  * C++03 is no longer supported; a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.7 or later, and MSVC 12.0 (VS 2013) or later.)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/leaf/ LEAF]:]
  * New API for transporting of error objects and exceptions between threads: `try_capture_all`.
  * `result<T>` able to transport exceptions captured via `try_capture_all`.
  * `result<T>` transporting dynamically captured error objects with improved efficiency.
  * Old `make_shared_context`/`capture` APIs are deprecated, will be removed in the next release.
  * Removed support for transporting of dynamicaly captured error objects in exceptions.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/lexical_cast/ LexicalCast]:]
  * Significant rewrite of the internal logic to separate optimized and C++ Standard Library IO-based streams:
    * C++ Standard Library based streams now constructed in less cases leading to [*better performance];
    * less template instantiations and simpler code;
    * always use `std::char_traits` (do not use custom traits from input/output types as it leads to linktime or runtime errors);
    * fixed missuse of forward declared boost::array (thanks to [@https://github.com/13steinj 13steinj] for the report [github lexical_cast 64]!);
    * support for `volatile` input types was dropped, following the C++ Standard Library trend.
  * Optimized conversions from std::basic_string_view and boost::basic_string_view  [github lexical_cast 30].
  * Dropped dependency on Boost.NumericConversion and Boost.MPL. Fixed some cases
    of converting floting point types to arithmetics.
  * The library now compiles and works fine with `-fno-sanitize-recover=integer` [github lexical_cast 45].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/locale/ Locale]:]
  * Fix linker issues due to missing typeinfo for `char8_t` in C++20 mode
  * Fix IConv compile flags when using ICU that has a bundled IConv
  * `collator` now throws on construction, if at all, as documented
  * `collator` no longer derives from `std::collator` to avoid possible type confusing when it isn't available for the current backend [github_pr locale 216]
  * Throw an exception when a faulty IConv library is detected (e.g. on some MacOS versions) instead of looping indefinitely [github_pr locale 218]
  * Reduce resolution of `date_time` to seconds as milliseconds where not easily available causing confusion [github locale 221]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/msm/ MSM]:]
  * [* Major Update]. Backend update (back11). Requires C++ 11. The documentation now uses it as default.
  * [* Big new feature]. New front-end (PlantUML). Requires C++ 20 
  * Various Bugfixes (compiler errors and warnings, priority of deferred events)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/mysql/ MySQL]:]
  * [*Breaking change]: Boost.MySQL now requires linking to the new [*Boost.Charconv] compiled library.
    This addresses a locale-dependency problem, increases efficiency, and powers the new client-side SQL formatting feature.
  * Added experimental support for [*connection pools], which allows re-using sessions and provides
    built-in reconnection and error handling.
  * Added experimental support for [*type-erased connections] (`any_connection` class).
    `any_connection` is not a template and features simpler connection establishment and reconnection semantics.
  * Added experimental support for [*client-side SQL formatting functions] (`format_sql` and `format_sql_to`).
    These allow securely composing queries client-side, which enables patterns like batch inserts,
    dynamic filters or PATCH-like updates.
  * Fixed a performance issue affecting `close_statement` and `async_close_statement` that could cause significant delays in application code.
  * Added support for building with `BOOST_ASIO_USE_TS_EXECUTOR_AS_DEFAULT`.
  * The deprecated execution interface (`connection::query`, `connection::start_query`,
    `connection::execute_statement`, `connection::start_statement_execution` and their async counterparts)
    now triggers warnings, as it's scheduled for removal in Boost 1.86.
  * Fixed a bug that caused some error messages to be truncated.
  * Warning cleanup. Builds are now clean from warnings when building with `-Wall` and `-Wextra`.
  * All `field_view` constructors are now stable.
  * The library internals have been rewritten using a sans-io approach to reduce complexity.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/pfr/ PFR]:]
  * `boost::pfr::get_name` now can work with local types on some compilers.
    Thanks to [@https://github.com/schaumb Bela Schaum] for the PR [github_pr pfr 152]!
  * Removed unused implementation details. Thanks to
    [@https://github.com/denzor200 Denis Mikhailov] for the PR [github_pr pfr 154].
  * Allow throwing exceptions from `boost::pfr::structure_to_tuple`. Thanks to
    [@https://github.com/denzor200 Denis Mikhailov] for the bug report [github pfr 155].
  * Field reflection trick is now described in the docs. Thanks to all the
    discussion participans in [github pfr 150]!

* [phrase library..[@/libs/system/ System]:]
  * C++03 is no longer supported; a C++11 compiler is required.
    (This includes GCC 4.8 or later, and MSVC 14.0 (VS 2015) or later.)
  * The deprecated header `boost/system/cygwin_error.hpp` has been removed.
  * The original and obsolete (32 bit) MinGW is no longer supported. MinGW-w64 (both 64 and 32 bit) is still supported.
  * `operator&` now works for `result<void>` (by way of taking a nullary function.)
  * Added `operator|=` for `result`.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/stacktrace/ Stacktrace]:]
  * [*Big new feature: stacktrace from arbitrary exception].
    On some POSIX platforms `std::stacktrace::from_current_exception()` now
    returns the stacktrace of the current exception object as if the stacktrace
    was captures at the point of throwing the exception. Many thanks to
    Andrei Nekrashevich for prototyping the idea in `libsfe`.
  * Fixed memory consumption on Windows with `boost_stacktrace_windbg`. Thanks
    to [@https://github.com/ycyclop ycyclop] for reporting the issue
    [github stacktrace 111], to [@https://github.com/correa Thiago A. Correa]
    for providing more information, to
    [@https://github.com/akarpovskii Andrei Karpovskii] for providing a
    possible fix.
  * Fixed lbrary build with non hidden visibility. Thanks to
    [@https://github.com/JBouwer Jan Bouwer] for the report and information on
    how to fix it.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/stl_interfaces/ STLInterfaces]:]
  * Change the behavior of `iterator_interface` for input iterators in C++20
    and later, to more closely follow the C++20 concepts.
  * Remove hidden friends from `iterator_interface` to fix errors about
    concepts being redefined with different constraints.
  * Add a new `v3` inline namespace, containing a new iterator_interface based
    on deducing this instead of CRTP (C++23 and later).
  * Add an rvalue-qualified overload of `closure::operator()`, to prevent
    dangling temporaries.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/unordered/ Unordered]:]
  * Optimized `emplace()` for a `value_type` or `init_type` (if applicable) argument to bypass
    creating an intermediate object. The argument is already the same type as the would-be intermediate object.
  * Optimized `emplace()` for `k,v` arguments on map containers to delay constructing the object
    until it is certain that an element should be inserted. This optimization happens when the
    mapâ€™s `key_type` is move constructible or when the `k` argument is a  `key_type`.
  * Fixed support for allocators with explicit copy constructors ([github_pr unordered 234]).
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/variant/ Variant]:]
  * Removed more of the pre-C++11 macro and workarounds.
