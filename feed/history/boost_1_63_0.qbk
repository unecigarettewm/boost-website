[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/atomic/ Atomic]:]
  * Added the static constant `atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free` for conformance with C++17. The constant indicates that the given specialization always provides lock-free implementation of atomic operations.
  * Improved support of Oracle Studio on x86 targets.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/fiber/ Fiber]:]
  * unbounded_channel<> and bounded_channel<> renamed to unbounded_queue<> and bounded_queue<>
  * macro BOOST_FIBERS_SPINLOCK_YIELD to invoke std::this:thread::yield() while busy waiting

* [phrase library..[@/libs/log/ Log]:]
  * General changes:
    * Removed the previously deprecated `type_info_wrapper`.
  * New features:
    * Added a way to access the current file name from the text file sink backend. The file name can be obtained with the `get_current_file_name` method.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed compilation errors for Android API prior to version 21.
    * Streaming operators now take scalar types and enums by value. This allows to output static constants and bitfields directly into formatting stream and record stream. ([ticket 11998])
    * In UDP socket based syslog backend implementation, changed the syslog message format for better compliance with RFC3164.
    * File close handler installed in text file sink backend is no longer called if the file is not open yet.
  * See [@/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html changelog] for more details.

* /TODO/

[/ TODO: These libraries always use the same message, referring to their
   individual release notes. So check if they apply before the beta:
